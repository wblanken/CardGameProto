# Card Game Prototype

A prototype of making a card game in UE5 with tooling to pull data from an API for the cards. Using the Marvel Champions card game by Fantasy Flight Games, none of the data is owned by this project and is just being used as a jumping off point to test features. Please support the game by actually buying it.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
